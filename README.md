# My Dotfiles

## Installing
1. Download the source to a location of your choosing.
2. Update the 'DOTFILESDIR' variable in the update.sh file.
3. Run install.sh - this will copy the dotfiles into the your homedir.

If you change the files in the root you can copy them back into the repo using 'update.sh' which automatically gets copied into the homedir

## .vimrc
I love my .vimrc, it is my pride and joy. It is split into seperate configuration files in the '~/.vim/config/ folder to keep things organised.

The font set in ~/.vim/config/gVim.vim can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/eugeneching/consolas-powerline-vim)
