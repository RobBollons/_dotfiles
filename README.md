## Installing
1. Download the source to a location of your choosing.
2. Run `chmod +x INSTALL` to make the INSTALL file executable.
3. Run `./INSTALL`.

## .vimrc
I love my .vimrc, it is my pride and joy. It is split into seperate configuration files in the '~/.vim/config/ folder to keep things organised.

The font set in ~/.vim/config/gui.vim can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro)
