# My Dotfiles

## Installing
1. Download the source to a location of your choosing.
2. Update the 'DOTFILESDIR' variable in the update.sh file.
3. Run 'install.sh' - this will copy the dotfiles into the your homedir.

If you change the files in the homedir you can copy them back into the repo using 'update.sh'.

## .vimrc
I love my .vimrc, it is my pride and joy. It is split into seperate configuration files in the '~/.vim/config/ folder to keep things organised.

The font set in ~/.vim/config/gui.vim can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/eugeneching/consolas-powerline-vim).
